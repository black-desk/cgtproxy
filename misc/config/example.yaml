version: 1
cgroup-root: AUTO # path to cgroupfs v2 mount point or "AUTO"
route-table: 300

# This means any traffic send to 127.0.0.1 and ::1 will be directly send
# without influenced by the following configuration.
bypass:
  - 127.0.0.0/8
  - ::1

tproxies:
  clash-meta:
    mark: 3000
    port: 7893

    # Do not proxy UDP traffic. They will be send directly.
    # no-udp: false

    # Do not proxy IPv6 traffic. They will be send directly.
    # no-ipv6: false

    # Hijack all IPv4 traffic which destination port is 53
    # and redirect them to ip:port.
    # This field is optional.
    dns-hijack:
      ip: 127.0.0.1

# Rules are matched in order.
# `match` is an regex to match the cgroup path.
# `direct` means the traffic will not be redirect to any TPROXY server;
# `drop` means the traffic will be drop;
# `tproxy` means the traffic will be redirect to that TPROXY server.
#
# NOTE: You can use systemd-cgls to check the cgroup layout on your system.
#
# NOTE: Any web service will provide their service directly.
#       Traffics in connection created by remote host
#       will never redirect to TPROXY server or drop.
rules:
  # This rule match the clash-meta core.
  # Make cgtproxy produce nft rules that
  # route the network traffic comes from this cgroupfs as usual.
  - # AUR packages `clash-meta` and `clash-meta-bin`
    # contains the `clash-meta` systemd service,
    # which will be launched by systemd
    # in cgroup `/system.slice/clash-meta.service`.
    # But [my clash-meta deb package](https://github.com/black-desk/debs/tree/master/one.metacubex.clash-meta)
    # use a systemd service name `one.metacubex.clash-meta`.
    match: |-
      \/system\.slice\/(?:one\.metacubex\.)?clash-meta\.service
    direct: true

  # Same as above.
  # Let's configure the user-level `cgtproxy-direct.slice`,
  # `cgtproxy-proxy.slice` and `cgtproxy-drop.slice` cgroup.
  #
  # Using this setup, you can start a non-proxy shell
  # by execute:
  #
  # ```bash
  # systemd-run --user --slice cgtproxy-direct.slice --shell
  # ```
  #
  # The command above start the new shell in a cgroup like
  # `/user.slice/user-1000.slice/user@1000.service/cgtproxy.slice/cgtproxy-direct.slice/run-u22.service`,
  # which match the regex in your configuration.
  # Then cgtproxy will produce nft rules to
  # make that `run-u22.service` get rid of transparent proxy.
